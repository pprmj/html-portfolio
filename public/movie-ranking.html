<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Epic high fantasy action combined with intricate storytelling, an engrossing plotline, deep character development across their entire roster, and an unforgettable musical score.</p>
<h3>Fierce Creatures</h3>
<p>A sexy and funny adventurous romp detailing the wild lifestyles of the employees at Octopus Zoo as they strive to keep the zoo open amidst megaconglomerate corporate billionaire Rod McCain.  A crowd-pleasing display of fierce creatures to behold, and no we don't mean the animals.  From the excellent ensemble cast that brought you "A Fish Called Wanda".</p>
<h3>The Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>A brutally and hauntingly accurate depiction of the final hours of Jesus's life on Earth.  Starring Jim Caviezel and directed by Mel Gibson.</p>
