<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Who I am</h2>

<p>My name is Pedro Miranda and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer.  At the time of this reading (will have it auto-update), I am 38 years old, am happily married and have 1 beautiful baby boy.  From being fascinated by the breadth of computer games from the 1990s as well as the video game consoles of that era (Nintendo, Super Nintendo), I was an early adopter and afficianado to all things electronics, specifically computers and video gaming.</p>

<h2>Why Website Development?</h2>

<p>Desiring a change in my current working career, I have stumbled headfirst into learning the entire Web Development Stack from top to bottom, starting with basic HTML and working my way up to CSS, JavaScript as well as all of the other languages to REALLY make websites "sing and dance".</p>

<h2>Not just a Web Developer...</h2>

<p>I am entering the Full Stack Web Development space as an individual who can contribute not only to the creation and design of a personal/business website, but I also have a strong English proficiency, being able to not only code in English, but being able to add "brevity" and "zeal" to the written words on a webpage.</p>

<p>Yes!  It is true!  In addition to becoming proficient in Full Stack Web Development and showcasing all of my previous work here in this humble website, I also want to learn digital copywriting to help businesses drive more traffic and sales with their funnels.  But that is a journey for another time.</p>
